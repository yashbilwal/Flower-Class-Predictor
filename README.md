üå∏ Flower Class Prediction Web Application using Machine Learning
This project is a web-based flower classification application that leverages the power of machine learning to predict the species of flowers based on their physical features. The application is built using a React frontend (MERN stack) for a dynamic user interface and a Python backend powered by machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

üîç Project Overview:
Frontend: The frontend is built using React, which provides a seamless and interactive user experience. It captures the user‚Äôs input (the flower‚Äôs measurements) and displays the predicted class of the flower (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
Backend: The backend is developed using Node.js, serving as a middleware to handle requests from the frontend. The backend communicates with the Python script responsible for making predictions using the trained Decision Tree classifier on the famous Iris dataset.
Machine Learning Model: The core prediction functionality is powered by a Decision Tree Classifier, which is trained on the Iris dataset to predict the flower class based on features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
üß† Key Features:
User-friendly Interface: The interface allows users to input the physical features of a flower, and within seconds, the backend classifies the flower into one of the Iris species.
Fast Predictions: The backend uses a pre-trained Decision Tree model, offering instant classification results.
Interactive: The web interface is responsive and gives users an easy and engaging way to interact with the system.
Model Accuracy: The model is highly accurate, leveraging one of the most commonly used datasets for machine learning tasks, making it a reliable solution for flower classification.

‚ö° Features to Look Forward to:
Real-time Prediction: The system will immediately display the predicted flower class once the user inputs the measurements.
Model Updates: Future iterations may improve model performance, adding more complex algorithms, or using additional datasets for better generalization.
Interactive Visualizations: With future enhancements, the app could feature interactive charts and graphs to visualize the dataset and prediction confidence levels.
